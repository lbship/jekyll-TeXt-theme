一个简单的人，行走在路上，虽然有些坎坷，依然向往着光明的未来。
- The happiest of people don’t necessarily have the best of everything;they just make the most of everything that comes along their way  
- Dream what you want to dream;go where you want to go;be what you want to be,because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.
